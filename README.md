# AIR PARTICLES 

## SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide):

A gas typically produced by burning fossil fuels, like coal or oil, and by volcanic eruptions.
High levels of SO2 can cause respiratory problems and aggravate existing heart disease.
It's also a significant component in the formation of acid rain.


## PM10 (Particulate Matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers):

These are tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two and one half microns or less in width.
PM10 particles can include dust, pollen, mold, and other organic chemicals and can be harmful when inhaled, leading to respiratory issues and other health problems.


## PM2.5 (Particulate Matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers):

These are even smaller particles than PM10 and can penetrate deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream.
PM2.5 is considered more dangerous than PM10 due to its ability to cause more severe health issues, including lung and heart diseases.


## NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide):

A reddish-brown gas with a characteristic sharp, biting odor and is a prominent air pollutant.
NO2 forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment.
It contributes to the development of respiratory problems and can aggravate existing heart disease.


## CO (Carbon Monoxide):

A colorless, odorless gas that is harmful when inhaled in large amounts.
It's produced from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, like in car exhausts.
High levels of CO can be fatal, as it reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the bloodstream to critical parts of the body.


## O3 (Ozone):

At ground level, ozone is a harmful air pollutant and a significant component of smog.
Ozone can cause a variety of health problems, particularly for the lungs and respiratory system.


## C6H6 (Benzene):

A colorless or light yellow liquid at room temperature, with a sweet odor.
It's a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke.
Benzene is a known carcinogen, particularly linked to leukemia.
